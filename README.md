# BurnedTreesLeaveStumps

For some reason the 1.4 update of Rimworld removed the spawning of burned stumps. I assumed this was an oversight so I reported it but never heard any response.
So after I got a query about it on the Discord server I made this mod to fix it, its a simple Harmony-prefix that manually spawns a burned-stump if possible when a plant dies from flame. 
Original code still runs so should not affect anything else. Hopefully this will be fixed in future updates of the game.

This will also fix the generation of resources from these stumps, for example charcoal in the https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2195469123]Apothecary mod.
